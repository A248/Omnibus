/**
 * A parent class for iterators which simply redirect, a.k.a <i>proxy</i>, calls to another iterator (the backing iterator). <br>
 * Such iterators do nothing themselves except refer calls to their backing iterators. <br>
 * <br>
 * However, the proxy iterator's additional call layer provides fine tuned control over specific implementations. <br>
 * Programmers may extend this class to utilise this enhanced control. <br>
 * <br>
 * Note that a reference is retained to the backing iterator. Changes to the backing iterator are reflected in proxied iterators.
