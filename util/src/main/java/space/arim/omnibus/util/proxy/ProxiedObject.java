 * A general parent object for objects, which simply redirect, a.k.a. <i>proxy</i>, calls to another object (the backing object). <br>

 * <br>
 * Please note that <b>not all proxied objects are able to extend ProxiedObject. </b> <br>
 * Accordingly, ProxiedObject is only used as a default implementation; do not rely on proxying classes extending ProxiedObject. <br>
 * If the proxy type is an interface, then the proxy object may extend this class and use it for basic implementation.
 * However, if the proxy type is a class, then the proxy object, in order to maintain the same type as its backing object,
 * must extend the proxy type, thereby preventing it from extending ProxiedObject.
