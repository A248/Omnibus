/**
 * A {@link Executor} with upgraded concurrent functionality. Focuses specifically on concurrent execution and scheduling,
 * and as such there are no methods for thread pool management (such as shutdown, await termination, etc.) as in
 * {@link ExecutorService}. <br>
 * <br>
 * Methods come in 3 categories. First, basic execution. Second, scheduling delayed tasks. Third, scheduling repeating
 * tasks. No method may return {@code null}. No parameters may ever be {@code null}. <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Basic Usage</b> <br>
 * For basic asynchronous work, {@link #execute(Runnable)}, {@link #submit(Runnable)}, and {@link #supply(Supplier)}
 * may be used. <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Delayed Scheduling</b> <br>
 * The <i>scheduleOnce</i> methods provide delayed scheduling. The delay is provided as a {@link Duration}.
 * All these methods returned {@link ScheduledWork}. Such {@code ScheduledTask}s may be used to cancel
 * the task before it begins execution. <br>
 * <br>
 * The work scheduled may be specified in 2 variants. First, it may be a simple {@code Runnable}, which is simply run.
 * Second, it may be a {@code Supplier}, whose supplied value becomes the result of the returned {@code ScheduledTask},
 * which is completed once the supplier itself completes processing. <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Repeated Scheduling</b> <br>
 * The <i>scheduleRepeating</i> methods provide repeated scheduling. Similarly to delayed scheduling, the initial delay
 * is provided as a {@code Duration} and all methods return {@code ScheduledTask}. However, unlike delayed scheduling,
 * the {@code ScheduledTask} returned may be cancelled, or the {@code ScheduledTask} provided as an input to the functional
 * work parameter may be cancelled. Cancellation, if invoked, will prevent future executions of the task from beginning,
 * but in-progress work will not be cancelled. (Thus the {@code mayInterruptIfRunning} parameter to
 * {@link ScheduledWork#cancel(boolean)} has no effect) <br>
 * <br>
 * The work scheduled may be specified in 4 variants. First, it may be a simple {@code Runnable}, which is simply run
 * repeatedly. Second, it may be a {@code Supplier}, whose supplied value becomes the result of the {@code ScheduledTask}s
 * related to the task. Third, it may be a {@code Consumer}, which accepts the task itself, allowing the execution to cancel
 * further scheduling of itself. Fourth, it may be a {@code Function}, which accepts the task itself <i>and</i> becomes the
 * result of the {@code ScheduledTask}s in question. <br>
 * <br>
 * Each method takes a {@link DelayCalculator} whose responsibility it is to calculate the next delay, based on both the previous
 * delay and the execution time. {@link DelayCalculators} may be used for common useful implementations of such interface.
 * The {@code DelayCalculator} calculating a negative delay is equivalent to cancellation of the {@code ScheduledTask}.
 * <br>
 * No executions may ever overlap. That is, the next execution of a task will never commence while an existing execution is in
 * progress. With regards to the value of the {@code ScheduledTask}, each time the task completes the value will be set to
 * the newly completed value and dependent actions will be triggered. Awaiting completion will always await the next completion
 * of the task. {@link CompletionStage#toCompletableFuture()} will return a future representing a "snapshot" of the current
 * scheduled iteration, which is completed once the next execution completes.
