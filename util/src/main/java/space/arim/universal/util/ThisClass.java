/**
 * Simple utility to get one's own literal class, including in a static context. <br>
 * <br>
 * The most common use case is where one requires a statically constructed {@code Logger}: <br>
 * <code>private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(LoggingClass.class);</code> <br>
 * <br>
 * where <i>LoggingClass</i> is the class in which the logger is placed. This approach is prone to particular
 * error due to the class literal passed to <code>LoggerFactory.getLogger</code>. If improperly copied
 * and pasted, the wrong logger might be retrieved. <br>
 * <br>
 * The solution involves using this utility class to determine the class: <br>
 * <code>private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(ThisClass.get());</code> <br>
 * <br>
 * The improved code uses <code>ThisClass.get()</code> instead of the class literal, and thus may be copied
 * and pasted at will with no fear of error. <br>
 * <br>
 * Moreover, <code>ThisClass.get()</code> is more readable than the alternative <code>MethodHandles.lookup().lookupClass()</code>.
