/**
 * Marks methods for listening to events. <br>
 * <br>
 * The method must be and public, non-static, and in a public class. The method must have {@code void} return type.
 * Also, it must have a single parameter which is assignment-compatible with <code>Event.class</code>. If any of
 * these requirements are not met, an unchecked exception is thrown (usually {@link IllegalListenerException}). <br>
 * <br>
 * The single parameter of the listening method determines the event which will be listened to. More formally,
 * for any event <code>evt</code>, if the <code>evt</code> is an instance of the parameter type,
 * the listening method will be invoked when the method is thrown. Listening to superclasses is, therefore,
 * supported. <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Inheritance</b>
 * Listening methods, unlike normal methods, cannot be inherited. If inheritance is required, then it may be better
 * to switch to dynamic event listening via {@link Events#registerListener(Class, byte, java.util.function.Consumer)}.
