/**
 * A manager responsible for marshalling shared resources, avoiding duplication of the same
 * resource interface. <br>
 * <br>
 * Sharing resources consists in multiple moving parts. First, all clients requiring a specific resource
 * register a {@link ResourceHook} using {@link #hookUsage(Class, Supplier)}. The {@code Supplier} is used
 * to create the default implementation of the resource, as a {@link ResourceInfo}, and is invoked either
 * immediately or lazily by the {@code ResourceManager} implementation. There is one such {@code Supplier}
 * for each resource hook representing that hook's preferred implementation should be it be asked to provide
 * the resource provider. <br>
 * <br>
 * The resource implementation is said to be the resource provider; only one provider may exist at once.
 * {@link ResourceHook#getResource()} should be used whenever the resource is needed, to return the current
 * resource provider. <br>
 * <br>
 * When the resource hook is no longer required, it should be unhooked via {@link #unhookUsage(ResourceHook)}.
 * If such hook's resource provider was used, it will be shut down. First, {@link ShutdownHandler#preShutdownEvent()}
 * will be called. Next, a {@link ShutdownEvent} will be fired using the {@link Events} instance ({@link #getEvents()}).
 * Finally, {@link ShutdownHandler#postShutdownEvent()}. <br>
 * <br>
 * Any remaining resource hooks may listen to the shutdown event and act accordingly. Some resources may require
 * some form of "migration". For example, presume a kind of scheduling service, which returns tasks which may be cancelled.
 * Scheduler users, having cached such cancellable tasks in fields, may need to discard the previous tasks and restart
 * them using the new scheduler implementation.
