/**
 * A {@link Executor} with upgraded concurrent functionality. Focuses
 * specifically on concurrent execution and scheduling, and as such there are no
 * methods for thread pool management (such as shutdown, await termination,
 * etc.) as in {@link ExecutorService}. <br>
 * <br>
 * Methods come in 3 categories: basic execution, one time delayed tasks, and
 * repeating tasks. Delays are specified in {@link Duration}. <br>
 * <br>
 * No method may return {@code null}. No parameters may ever be {@code null},
 * and {@code NullPointerException} will be thrown otherwise. <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Basic Usage</b> <br>
 * For basic asynchronous work, {@link #execute(Runnable)},
 * {@link #submit(Runnable)}, and {@link #supply(Supplier)} may be used. <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Delayed Scheduling</b> <br>
 * {@link #scheduleOnce(Runnable, Duration)} provides delayed scheduling. The
 * delay is provided as a {@link Duration}. Returned {@link ScheduledTask}s may
 * be used to cancel the task before it begins execution. <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Repeated Scheduling</b> <br>
 * The <i>scheduleRepeating</i> methods provide repeated scheduling.
 * Cancellation will prevent future executions of the task from beginning, but
 * in-progress work will not be cancelled. <br>
 * <br>
 * Each method takes a {@link DelayCalculator} whose responsibility it is to
 * calculate the next delay, based on both the previous delay and the execution
 * time. {@link DelayCalculators} may be used for common useful implementations
 * of such interface. The {@code DelayCalculator} calculating a negative delay
 * is equivalent to cancellation of the {@code ScheduledTask}. <br>
 * No executions may ever overlap. That is, the next execution of a task will
 * never commence while an existing execution is in progress.
