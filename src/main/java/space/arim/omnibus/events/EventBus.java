/**
 * A framework for firing events and listening to them. <br>
 * <br>
 * To listen to events, use
 * {@link #registerListener(Class, byte, EventConsumer)}. The returned
 * {@code Listener} may be unregistered later. <br>
 * <br>
 * The event bus has guarantees regarding inheritance of events. When an event
 * is fired, every listener which specified an event type which is assignment
 * compatible with the event object will be invoked. That is, the listener will
 * be called if the event is an instance of the specified event type. <br>
 * <br>
 * Note well that, unlike some other event buses, implementations are required
 * to provide consistent ordering of all listeners invoked by this method
 * according to their priorities, as opposed to merely ordering within listeners
 * specifying a certain event class. Thus, all applicable listeners to an event
 * are <i>always</i> invoked in order of priority, no matter which event nor its
 * inheritance heirarchy. <br>
 * <br>
 * To fire events, implement {@link Event} or {@link AsyncEvent} on the event
 * object and use one of the firing methods. <br>
 * <br>
 * Null parameters are not permitted on any method. {@code NullPointerException}
 * is thrown otherwise
