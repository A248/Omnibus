/**
 * A framework for firing events and listening to them. <br>
 * <br>
 * To listen to events, use {@link #registerListener(Class, byte, EventConsumer)}. The returned {@code Listener}
 * may be unregistered later. <br>
 * <br>
 * The event bus has guarantees regarding inheritance of events. When an event is fired, every listener which
 * specified an event type which is assignment compatible with the event object will be invoked. That is,
 * the listener will be called if the event is an instance of the specified event type. <br>
 * <br>
 * Note well that, unlike some other event buses, implementations are required to provide consistent ordering
 * of all listeners invoked by this method according to their priorities, as opposed to merely ordering within
 * listeners specifying a certain event class. Thus, all applicable listeners to an event are <i>always</i>
 * invoked in order of priority, no matter which event nor its inheritance heirarchy. <br>
 * <br>
 * To fire events, implement {@link Event} on the event object. Construct such an object and call one of the
 * {@code fire} methods. <br>
 * <br>
 * Null parameters are not permitted on any method. {@code NullPointerException} is thrown otherwise
