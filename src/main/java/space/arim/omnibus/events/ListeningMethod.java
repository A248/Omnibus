/**
 * Placed on methods to indicate it is intended they listen to an event. <br>

 * <br>
 * A listening method must ordinarily have a single parameter whose type is that

 * should accept two parameters; first, the event, second, a
 * {@link EventFireController}. <br>
 * <br>
 * Event classes must not be array types, primitive types, or {@code Object}.
 * The event type declared by the method must be public and unconditionally exported.
