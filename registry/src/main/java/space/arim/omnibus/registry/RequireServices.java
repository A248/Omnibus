/**
 * Denotes a requirement there must be a registration of specific service types in a {@link Registry}. <br>
 * Should be applied to either {@code Registry} parameters, or methods returning a <code>Registry</code>. <br>
 * <br>
 * If applied to a parameter, the parameter passed should have the service types registered.
 * If applied to a method, such method should return a registry with the service types registered. <br>
 * Such requirements should be validated immediately when the {@code Registry} is passed. <br>
 * <br>
 * For example, the constructor of the following example class would require its {@code Registry} parameter
 * to have a registration for the {@code Dummy} service: <br>
 * <pre>
 * public class Example {
 * 
 *   public Example(@RequireServices(Dummy.class) Registry registry) {
 *     // ...
