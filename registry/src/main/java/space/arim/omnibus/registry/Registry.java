/**
 * A framework for registering and loading services. <br>

 * Used to register providers of services which will be utilised
 * by dependents according to the priority of registration. <br>
 * <br>
 * A <i>service</i> is a type, usually an interface or abstract class, which
 * multiple programs may decide to implement. An implementation of a service
 * is considered a <i>provider</i>. <br>
 * <br>
 * Providers may be registered with a priority and an optional user friendly name.
 * These details comprise a <i>registration</i> (which is really just a wrapper
 * class for the provider, priority, and optional name). See {@link Registration}. <br>
 * <br>
 * The service class is the class corresponding to the service type.
