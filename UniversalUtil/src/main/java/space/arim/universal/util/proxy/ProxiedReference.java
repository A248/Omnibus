 * A helper for proxying final objects. <br>

 * However, in some cases, perfect proxying may not be possible. There can be no truly proxied <code>String</code>,
 * since <code>String</code> is <i>final</i>. <br>
 * <br>
 * This class represents an object which returns a proxied value. {@link CaptiveReference} may be used for a default implementation.
