/**
 * A workaround for overriding {@link Object#toString()} in interfaces. <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Usage:</b> <br>
 * Programmers should let an interface extend Stringable, then create a default implementation of {@link #toStringMe()} in the interface. <br>
 * Then, classes implementing that interface may use a simple <code>toString()</code> override, as follows: <br>
 * <code>
 * public String toString() {
 *   return toStringMe();
 * }
 * </code>
