/**
 * A scheduler designed for creating delayed and timed tasks.
 * <br>
 * <b>Specifications:</b> <br>
 * * Requires {@link #runTaskLater(Runnable, long)} <br>
 * * Requires {@link #runTaskTimerLater(Runnable, long, long)} <br>
 * * Default implementations: See below <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Contract:</b> <br>
 * * Each method returns a {@link Task} representing the scheduled task.
 * Such returned Task objects' {@link Task#cancel()} method should succeed in ceasing further scheduling of the task. <br>
 * * All time units are in <i>milliseconds</i> to provide compatibility with implementing platforms which do not support other units. <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Default implementations:</b> <br>
 * * {@link #runTaskTimer(Runnable, long)} calls {@link #runTaskTimerLater} with <code>delay</code> parameter as <code>0</code>.
 * This may be overriden if doing so increases efficiency. <br>
 * * All methods accept either a basic {@link Runnable} or a {@link Consumer} as the task to schedule.
 * Callers may use the method accepting a consumer parameter so that the executing task can cancel its own scheduling.
 * Default implementations need never be overriden. They derive from the corresponding methods accepting Runnable parameters.
