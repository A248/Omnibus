	 * <br>
	 * For example, if the fixed rate is 4 seconds, an execution timeline might be as follows: <br>
	 * {@literal |--- d ----|} |<i>E</i>| {@literal |- d -|} |{@literal --}<i>E</i>{@literal --}| {@literal |- d -|} <br>

	 * Should execution time take longer than the fixed rate of delay, the function will: <br>
	 * 1. Return a zero (nonexistent) delay to immediately commence the next execution.
	 * 2. Temporarily accelerate future executions in order to "correct" any waverings from the fixed rate schedule.
	 * Thus, if a single execution takes a long time, it will not ruin the rate
