/**
 * Provides default implementations for {@link EnhancedExecutor}'s scheduling methods' delay functions. <br>
 * <br>
 * Recall that <code>Binary</code> operators take into account execution time, while <code>Unary</code> operators do not. <br>
 * Also, note that delay functions are applied after each execution. The first delay is determined by the initial
 * delay passed as a parameter to the scheduling methods themselves. Therefore,
 * <code>executor.schedule(this::runSomeTask, 5, DelayFunctions.exponential(2), TimeUnit.SECONDS)<br>, where <code>executor</code>
 * is an instance of <code>EnhancedExecutor</code>, will schedule some task so that, after five seconds, it is executed,
 * then there is a 10 second delay before the next execution, then a 20 second delay, etc. <br>
 * <br>
 * Fixed delay: {@link #fixedDelay()} <br>
 * Fixed rate: {@link #fixedRate()} <br>
 * Variable rate: {@link #variableRate(LongUnaryOperator)} <br>
 * Linear delay: {@link #linear(long)} <br>
 * Exponential delay: {@link #exponential(long)} <br>
 * Logarithmic delay: {@link #logarithmic(long)}
