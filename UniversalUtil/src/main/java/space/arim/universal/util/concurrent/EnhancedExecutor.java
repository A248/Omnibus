/**
 * A {@link Executor} with upgraded concurrent functionality. Focuses specifically on concurrent execution and scheduling, as such
 * there are no methods for thread pool management (such as shutdown, await termination, etc.) as in {@link java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService ExecutorService}. <br>
 * <br>
 * {@link #decorate(Executor)} may be used to enhance a <code>Executor</code> into a <code>EnhancedExecutor</code>. <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Specifications:</b> <br>
 * * Requires {@link Executor#execute(Runnable)} <br>
 * * EnhancedExecutor provides default implementations for all of its own specifications. <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Qualities:</b> <br>
 * <br>
 * Adds {@link #submit(Runnable)} and {@link #supply(Supplier)} for basic asynchronous work. <br>
 * <br>
 * Adds several scheduling methods to enable timed execution. Programmers may, if desired, dynamically provide
 * the time between executions based on a delay function. <br>
 * Scheduling comes in many variants. {@link #schedule(Runnable, long, TimeUnit)} may be used for a one{@literal -}off delayed task
 * (delays and then fires once, without repeating). <br>
 * <br>
 * There are several variant methods, which follow <i>{@literal schedule(Runnable/Consumer, long, LongUnaryOperator/LongBinaryOperator, TimeUnit)}</i>,
 * which allow for repeating delayed tasks. <br>
 * The <code>Runnable</code> is the execution to run, or a <code>Consumer</code> if the task must be able to access itself.
 * The <code>long</code> is the initial delay. If negative, nothing happens and all further scheduling is cancelled.
 * If zero, task eexecution begins immediately. <br>
 * The <code>LongUnaryOperator</code> or <code>LongBinaryOperator</code> is the <i>delay function</i> used to calculate the delay
 * before the next execution. All executions are guaranteed not to overlap. This is ensured in the default implementation and should
 * likewise be upheld in overriding implementations. <br>
 * If the delay function is "Unary", it takes the last delay as the input; "Unary" delay functions calculate the next delay
 * based only on the previous delay. If "Binary", the delay function takes the last delay as the left input and
 * the last execution time as the right input. Essentially, "Binary" delay functions generate the next delay
 * based on the previous delay and the execution time. For simple implementations, {@link DelayFunctions} may be used. <br>
 * The TimeUnit is the unit which the initial delay is specified in and the unit which the delay function uses.
 * However, note that while <code>TimeUnit.NANOSECONDS</code> is a possible parameter,
 * implementations are not guaranteed further precision than milliseconds time. <br>
 * The method variants are:
 * ({@link #schedule(Runnable, long, LongUnaryOperator, TimeUnit)} / {@link #schedule(Consumer, long, LongUnaryOperator, TimeUnit)} /
 * {@link #schedule(Runnable, long, LongBinaryOperator, TimeUnit)} / {@link #schedule(Consumer, long, LongBinaryOperator, TimeUnit)}).
