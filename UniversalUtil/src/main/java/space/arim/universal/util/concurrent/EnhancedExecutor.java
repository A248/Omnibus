/**
 * A {@link Executor} with upgraded concurrent functionality. Focuses specifically on concurrent execution and scheduling,
 * as such there are no methods for thread pool management (such as shutdown, await termination, etc.) as in
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService ExecutorService}. <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Basic Usage</b> <br>
 * For basic asynchronous work, {@link #execute(Runnable)}, {@link #submit(Runnable)}, and {@link #supply(Supplier)} may be used. <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Scheduling</b> <br>
 * Adds several scheduling methods to enable timed execution. Programmers may, if desired, dynamically provide
 * the time between executions based on a delay function. <br>
 * Scheduling comes in many variants. First, {@link #schedule(Runnable, long, TimeUnit)} may be used
 * for a one{@literal -}off delayed task (delays and then fires once, without repeating). <br>
 * <br>
 * There variant methods follow the pattern
 * <i>{@literal schedule(Runnable/Consumer, long, SimpleDelayCalculator/AdvancedDelayCalculator, TimeUnit)}</i>,
 * which allow for powerful usage of repeating delayed tasks. <br>
 * The <code>Runnable</code> is the execution to run, or a <code>Consumer</code> if the task must be able to access itself.
 * The <code>long</code> is the initial delay. If negative, nothing happens and all further scheduling is cancelled.
 * If zero, task execution begins immediately. <br>
 * <br>
 * The <code>SimpleDelayCalculator</code> or <code>AdvancedDelayCalculator</code> is the <i>delay function</i>
 * used to calculate the delay before the next execution. No executions will overlap. <br>
 * If the delay function is "Simple", it takes the last delay as the input and calculates the next delay accordingly.
 * If "Advanced", the delay function takes the last delay and the last execution time to calculate the next delay. <br>
 * For useful implementations of delay functions, {@link DelayFunctions} may be used. <br>
 * <br>
 * The TimeUnit is the unit which the initial delay is specified in and the unit which the delay function uses.
